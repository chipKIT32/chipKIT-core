/* 
 * Wire library BUGS
 * =================
 *
 * Multiple init bug - bperrybap
 * -----------------------------
 * What I saw is that there is some sort of h/w initialization issue in the twi_init() code.
 * I tracked it down to the twi_init() function down in the pic32 libraries/Wire/utility/twi.c
 * Here is the line that creates the issue:
 * 
 * // Enable the interrupt controller and turn on clock stretching.
 * ptwi->ixCon.reg = (1 << _I2CCON_ON) | (1 << _I2CCON_STREN);
 * 
 * But it is more complex than just that line.
 * 
 * The system really doesn't lock up there, as the twi_init() function does return.
 * It gets stuck on future Wire calls.
 */


/*
 * Wire library TODO List
 * ======================
 *
 * There is a major flaw in the twi_init function which, if called twice,
 * causes the I2C interface to lock up, and all subsequent transfers will
 * cause the system to freeze waiting for transfers to complete.  Armour
 * code has been added to circumvent the problem, but a proper investigation
 * needs to be done into why (see above).
 *
 * The armor code needs to have a bus deconfiguration routine written to
 * reset the I2C bus to a clean state (as it was before begin was called)
 * so that the whole module can be disabled any time and re-enabled cleanly
 * later.
